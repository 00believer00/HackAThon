            Set Monthly Budgets: Allocate specific amounts for each category (e.g., $400 for dining) and track adherence.
            Limit Impulse Purchases: Use a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases to curb impulse buying. Consider setting aside a small monthly budget for discretionary spending.
            Review Subscriptions: Audit all subscriptions and cancel those that are rarely used. You could save up to $600 annually by cutting unnecessary subscriptions.
            Optimize Payment Timings: Since most spending happens on weekends, try shifting non-essential purchases to weekdays, where possible, to avoid impulsive weekend splurges.
            Use Cash for Small Purchases: Consider using cash instead of cards for daily small expenses like coffee. This can make you more conscious of your spending.
